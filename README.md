# AI Pathfinder Robot
### Jiaming Zhao

pathfinding + uncertainty solved with AI  

in this world,  
x+1 will move robot down (south) vice versa  
y+1 will move robot right (east) vice versa  

pathfinding with certainty DONE:
uses A star search to find the best path quickly  
regenerate the path by reversing the map of points that led there  
moves robot diagonally (which is faster)
